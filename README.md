# prototypes
repository for rapid prototypes, not for production code


This respoitory is a place for all rapid prototypes generated by the Jamvent team.

This is NOT the home for any actual code for use as control or UI software, but can allow us to collaborate on rapidly prototyping code...

The master branch is subject to code review, but nothing too stringent at this point.
